# Shadow Detector

This work is the final project for the course _Computer Vision_ that I attended during my master degree at Department of Information Engineering (Padova, Italy). See `report.pdf` for the report containing the description of the presented algorithm and the analysis of the produced results.

The purpose of this project is to implement a shadow detector.

## 1. Assumptions

The shadow detector is developed under the following assumptions:

- One strong source of light (dataset images are all outdoor images where the only source of light is the sun)

- Focus on ground shadows

## 2. Methodology

The features considered by the shadow detector for the comparison of different segments of the image are intensity, color information and texture.

The shadow detector method is divided in the following steps:

0.  Preprocessing: filters are applied to the image in order to get better results in the segmentation step

1.  Segmentation: ùëòmeans is used to segment the image

2.  Intensity thresholding: image is converted to HSV color space and the intensity channel is thresholded

3.  Candidates computation: segments belonging to the white components of the thresholded image (at point 2) are selected as shadow candidates

4.  Candidates merging: ‚Äúsimilar‚Äù candidates are merged

5.  Candidates comparison: candidates are compared with their non-candidate neighbors and selected as shadow based on chromaticity and texture

## 3. Dataset

- [SVHN Training set](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/train.tar.gz)

- [SVHN Test set](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/test.tar.gz)

## 4. Examples of Detected Shadows
